<h2>Guns And Perks</h2>

<p>The Kuda is a fully automatic weapon, and is also one of the weapons you'll start with when you play your first or second game. It doesn't need a specific weapon to use and it could be equipped to your loadout immediately. It has moderate damage, and has decent range while at it. It also has a medium-paced firing rate, and fine accuracy. The Kuda after Black Ops 3 was made, was one of the best weapons in the game.</p>
