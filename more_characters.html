<h2>Guns And Perks</h2>
<p>In this section of multiplayer, I will be showing you the weapons and the added weapons on the game. I will also be showing you the perks and how they function. There are many sorts of guns such as sub-machine guns, assault rifles, snipers, light machine guns, and shotguns. There are also secondary weapons such as pistols, rocket launchers, and melee weapons. I will be showing you all of the picture of the weapon, the name of the weapon, the attachments that can be added to the weapon, and the category of which weapon is which.</p>

<h2>Sub-Machine Guns:</h2>

<p>The Kuda is a fully automatic weapon, and is also one of the weapons you'll start with when you play your first or second game. It doesn't need a specific weapon to use and it could be equipped to your loadout immediately. It has moderate damage, and has decent range while at it. It also has a medium-paced firing rate, and fine accuracy. The Kuda after Black Ops 3 was made, was one of the best weapons in the game.</p>

<p>The VMP is famous for dealing one of the most highest damage a gun could do in a game. The VMP has a little bit of recoil, and a high fire rate. One of the biggest drawback to this weapon, is that its a little inaccurate when aiming from very far distances. In the new update, the VMP's magazine has inccreased from 27 to 40 rounds. In order to unlock the VMP, you must meet the requirement of level 34.</p>
