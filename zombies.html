<h1>Zombies</h1>

<p>Ever since its appearance as a secret unlock at the end of World at War, the survival-based Zombies has become a staple of any Call of Duty game developed by Treyarch. From the Nazi undead of the first game mode, through to the gangster-based, narrative-lead Mob Of The Dead, this game mode has kept its undead slaughter cool. One thing is neverending which the fact that players face waasve after wave of ghouls and need to survive as long as they can, upgrading their abilities and guns as they continue to move on. In Blacks Ops 3 zombies there are variaties of maps. These maps are called Shadows Of Evil, Der Eisendrache, Gorod Krovi, and The Giant.</p>

<h2>Shadows Of Evil</h2>
<p>What you need to know about in zombies most importantly is Shadows Of Evil. This is a tribute to smoky 30's noir, just with added shambling. You play as one of four troubled and murderous individuals, trapped in the zombie-infested Morg City. This map contains a secret Easter Egg that will move you further on to the story of Zombies. If you buy the Collector's, Hardened or Juggernaut edition of Black Ops III, you will also get The Giant, a World War II themed map that is a remake of the original Zombies map Die Rise.</p>
